 <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
 <b>Something about me</b>
 <p>Hi,I'm Leen, and this is my second year at IIT.My major is Applied Cybersecurity and Information Technology.I'm an international student, but this is not my first time living in the US. I lived in North Carolina for a year, then moved to Arizona and stayed for a year.After that, I came to Illinois.I like Chicago so far, but it is not number one for me compared to cities I've been in. That would be Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
